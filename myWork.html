                   The amount of data on the website can be overwhelming. The solution was a redesign of the
                   website with an organized structure so that relevant information was brought to the
                   forefront along with links to other agency websites.

                <p class ="WorkSummary">We observed that the Greenmount West Community Center website presented a limited set of
                    information which resulted in the community having less knowledge about the wealth of services they provided
                    and donation opportunities. We redesigned the website so that the Greenmount West community could easily access
                    the GWCC offerings while simultaneously driving traffic to the website and increasing donations.

                <p class ="WorkSummary">The link2gether app is a mobile app that brings together people from different communities
                    and establishes a path of communication between small minority-owned businesses and their local customers.
                    The events following the George Floyd incident and the BLM movement were the source of inspiration for link2gether.
                    How could small business owners with a minority background (African American, Latin, LGBTQ, or even women, etc..)
                    promote their businesses and survive in an ever changing environment?
